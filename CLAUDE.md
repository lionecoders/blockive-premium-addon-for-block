# MANDATORY PROJECT RULES

## Existing Functionality

Never remove:

* Existing block functionality
* Existing settings
* Existing attributes
* Existing controls
* Existing responsive behavior
* Existing hover behavior
* Existing motion effects
* Existing dynamic CSS
* Existing frontend functionality

unless explicitly approved.

## Inspector UI

The preferred Blockive inspector structure is:

```text
Native Gutenberg Settings
Native Gutenberg Styles
```

Do not create unnecessary duplicate navigation.

Use normal Gutenberg panels where appropriate.

Do not remove settings simply to simplify the UI.

All existing settings must remain accessible.

## Block Supports

Before changing `block.json` supports:

1. Check for duplicate Blockive functionality.
2. Check attribute dependencies.
3. Check editor behavior.
4. Check frontend behavior.
5. Check shared components.

Do not blindly add or remove Gutenberg supports.

## Attributes

Before changing attributes:

* Search the complete codebase.
* Check editor usage.
* Check save usage.
* Check PHP usage.
* Check dynamic CSS usage.
* Check frontend JavaScript usage.

Do not rename or remove attributes unnecessarily.

## Shared Components

Before modifying a shared component:

1. Find every block using it.
2. Identify all dependencies.
3. Consider regressions.
4. Test all affected blocks.

## Dynamic Blocks

For dynamic blocks, inspect:

* `block.json`
* PHP render callback
* `render.php`
* Query logic
* Escaping
* Sanitization
* Generated HTML
* Generated CSS

## Static Blocks

For static blocks, inspect:

* `edit.js`
* `save.js`
* Attributes
* Generated markup
* Generated classes
* Generated styles

---

# SECURITY RULES

Always use appropriate WordPress security practices.

Check for:

* Input validation
* Sanitization
* Output escaping
* Nonce verification
* Capability checks
* Secure AJAX
* Secure REST API endpoints

Use the appropriate function for the context, including when applicable:

* `sanitize_text_field()`
* `sanitize_key()`
* `absint()`
* `intval()`
* `floatval()`
* `wp_unslash()`
* `wp_kses_post()`
* `esc_html()`
* `esc_attr()`
* `esc_url()`
* `esc_url_raw()`

Do not apply sanitization or escaping blindly.

Choose functions appropriate for the actual data and output context.

---

# CODE QUALITY RULES

Always prefer:

* Clear code
* Reusable components
* Small focused changes
* Existing project patterns
* WordPress APIs
* Gutenberg APIs

Avoid:

* Duplicate code
* Unnecessary abstractions
* Unnecessary dependencies
* Over-engineering
* Large blind refactors
* Unrelated formatting changes

Do not mix large formatting changes with functional fixes.

---

# REQUIRED DEVELOPMENT CYCLE

Every major development cycle must follow:

## Stage 1: Review

Code Reviewer analyzes the relevant code.

## Stage 2: Test

QA Tester tests relevant blocks and templates.

## Stage 3: Prioritize

Team Lead combines and prioritizes findings.

## Stage 4: Fix

Fix Agent implements approved changes.

## Stage 5: Build

Run the relevant project build command.

## Stage 6: Re-Review

Code Reviewer checks the changes.

## Stage 7: Re-Test

QA Tester tests the affected functionality again.

## Stage 8: Approval

Team Lead decides whether the issue is resolved.

---

# DEFINITION OF DONE

An issue is complete only when:

* The root cause is understood.
* The fix is implemented.
* The plugin builds successfully.
* No new relevant errors are introduced.
* Code review passes.
* QA testing passes.
* Editor behavior works.
* Frontend behavior works.
* Responsive behavior works if applicable.
* No regression is detected.
* The Team Lead approves the result.

Build success alone is never sufficient.

---

# REPORTING

Maintain clear reports for:

* Code review findings
* QA testing
* Bug reports
* Prioritized issues
* Fix logs
* Project status

Recommended structure:

```text
docs/
└── ai-team/
    ├── architecture/
    ├── agents/
    ├── reviews/
    ├── tests/
    ├── fixes/
    └── team-lead/
```

The Team Lead should maintain a clear list of:

* Open issues
* Issues in progress
* Issues waiting for testing
* Resolved issues
* Blocked issues

---

# FIRST RULE FOR EVERY TASK

Before changing code:

1. Understand the task.
2. Inspect relevant files.
3. Identify dependencies.
4. Check existing implementation.
5. Check shared components.
6. Check possible regressions.
7. Make the smallest safe change.
8. Build.
